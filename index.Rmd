## Assignment 3 Submission

- The interactive plot will be built in plotly with the Orange dataset included with base R. I will plot the age of a tree versus its circumference.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(plotly)
```

## Age vs. Circumference of Oranges Trees 

```{r plot}
plot_ly(Orange, type = "scatter", x = ~age, y = ~circumference, color = ~Tree) 
```
